# Meals on Wheels

Meals on Wheels is focused on the development of an online ordering system application for MerryMeal, a charitable organization that prepares and delivers hot noon meals to adults living at home who are unable to cook for themselves, maintain their nutritional status due to age, disease, or disability. The service will be available Monday through Friday. Frozen meals will be provided to members who are not within a 10-kilometer radius of their outsourced kitchens and support over the weekend. Development environments used for the completion of the application are STS, and MySQL Workbench.

Meals on Wheels is a challenging project that required me to explore more on Spring Boot and Spring Security. A total of six types of users were able to use the application. Creating the backend for handling of all the users was confusing at first. After a few hours of planning, I managed to find a logic for the backend. I organized the code for the controllers, services, and config files to increase productivity within my team. Overall, this project was a great opportunity to learn more about Spring Security, APIs and Spring Framework.
